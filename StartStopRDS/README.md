# Starting and Stopping RDS instances using a Lambda function.

In order to save cost on computing resources, it is good practice to stop non-production RDS instances during non-business hours. To achieve that, this solution will implement a python lambda function triggered by a CloudWatch schedule event, the lambda function will perform a lookup on all RDS instances of the AWS account with the tag "Auto-StartStop-Enabled" = "true", and those that match the criteria will be stop/start. Also, a snapshot of the instance will be taken before the instance is stopped and a second lambda function will delete all snapshots older than 5 days (created by the previous lambda) every Friday.

## Tested with: 

| Environment | Application | Version  |
| ----------------- |-----------|---------|
| WSL2 Ubuntu 20.04 | Terraform | v1.2.1 |

## Initialization How-To:
Located in the root directory, make an "aws configure" to log into the aws account, and a "terraform init" to download the necessary modules and start the backend.

```bash
aws configure
terraform init
```

## Deployment How-To:

Located in the root directory, make the necessary changes in the variables.tf file and run the manifests:

> :warning: Since this is just a demo, all CloudWatch events are disabled, to enable it, change the variable "enable_event_rules" to "true" (without quotes)

```bash
terraform apply
```

## Debugging / Troubleshooting:

To test the lambda function you can use the following "testing event":

Start test:
```json
{
  "action": "start"
}
```

Stop test:
```json
{
  "action": "stop"
}
```
